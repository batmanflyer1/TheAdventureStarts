Erebus Amongst Stars (?) (Name Pending)
Quest Based Isomorphic Space Game
What if Sword and Sworcery and Endless Sea, but space.

The player plays the only survivor of a desaster that befell the ISe-Kharon (previous ship). The previous ship is played on as a tutorial on how to manage the flight systems, maintain supplies, and move around in the ship while orders are queued. 

To end the tutorial, the player finds themself floating on a piece of debris in space with no memories.
